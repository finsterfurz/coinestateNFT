# Smart Contract Architecture

## Contract Overview

The CoinEstate platform utilizes three main smart contracts:

### VaultBrickToken (ERC20)
- **Purpose**: Platform utility token
- **Features**: Capped supply, burnable, mintable
- **Standard**: ERC20 with OpenZeppelin extensions

### PropertyNFT (ERC721)
- **Purpose**: Fractional property ownership representation
- **Features**: Enumerable, URI storage, ownership tracking
- **Standard**: ERC721 with OpenZeppelin extensions

### VaultBrickSales
- **Purpose**: Token distribution and sales management
- **Features**: Automated distribution, payment handling
- **Integration**: Works with both VBK token and Property NFTs

## Technical Features

- UUPS proxy pattern implementation
- Safe upgrade mechanisms
- Version control and migration support

### Security
- OpenZeppelin security standards
- Reentrancy protection
- Access control mechanisms
- Emergency pause functionality

### Gas Optimization
- Efficient data structures
- Batch operations support
- Minimal external calls

## Testing Coverage

- Unit tests for all contract functions
- Integration tests for cross-contract interactions
- Security vulnerability testing
- Gas usage optimization tests

## Deployment

Supports deployment to:
- Local development networks
- Ethereum testnets (Goerli, Sepolia)
- Ethereum mainnet
- Layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum)

## Integration

### Frontend Integration
- Web3.js/Ethers.js compatibility
- Event listening for real-time updates
- Transaction status tracking

### Backend Integration
- Automated monitoring of contract events
- Background processing of blockchain data
- API endpoints for contract interaction
