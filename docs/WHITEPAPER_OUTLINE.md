## Detailed Sections Preview

### 2.1 MiCA Article 4(1)(d) Compliance Strategy

**NFT Exclusion Clause Alignment**

CoinEstate NFTs are specifically designed to qualify for the MiCA NFT exclusion under Article 4(1)(d), which excludes certain unique digital assets from the regulation's scope. Our compliance strategy includes:

- **Unique Digital Assets**: Each NFT represents access to a specific property community
- **Non-Fungible Nature**: Property-specific membership rights that cannot be subdivided
- **Utility Focus**: Community access and informational benefits, not financial instruments
- **Limited Series**: Capped collections tied to specific real estate assets

**Legal Opinion**: Weber & Associates has provided preliminary guidance that our NFT structure aligns with the exclusion criteria, subject to final MiCA implementation guidelines.

### 3.2 Smart Contract Design

**Core Contract Architecture**

```solidity
// Simplified example - full implementation pending audit
contract CoinEstateNFT is ERC721, AccessControl {
    // Property-specific metadata
    struct PropertyAccess {
        uint256 propertyId;
        bool analyticsAccess;
        bool governanceParticipation;
        uint256 mintTimestamp;
    }
    
    // Non-financial utility functions only
    mapping(uint256 => PropertyAccess) public tokenUtility;
    
    // Community verification
    function verifyMemberAccess(address member) external view returns (bool);
    
    // Advisory voting (non-binding)
    function submitAdvisoryVote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external;
}
```

### 6.1 Revenue Structure & Freezing

**90% Income Freezing Protocol**

To ensure MiCA compliance and prepare for potential regulated community benefits:

- **Frozen Revenue**: 90% of net property income held in segregated Swedbank Estonia accounts
- **Operating Fund**: 10% used for platform operations, legal compliance, development
- **Transparency**: All income/expense data published monthly on member dashboard
- **Future Activation**: Frozen funds available for compliant distribution post-MiCA approval

**Legal Protection**: This structure prevents accidental securities classification while preserving future community benefit opportunities under proper regulation.
