- **Commit verification**: All commits are cryptographically secured

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Access Control
- Repository owner has exclusive write access
- Collaborators must be explicitly granted permissions
- Two-factor authentication recommended for account security

### Code Integrity
- Git commit hashing ensures code integrity
- Commit history is tamper-evident
- Signed commits provide additional verification

### Contribution Security
- External contributions via pull request only
- Repository owner controls all merge decisions
- Fork repositories do not affect original codebase

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations
