## üìä Development Patterns Demonstrated

### **Smart Contract Patterns**
```solidity
// Upgradeable proxy pattern
contract VaultBrickToken is ERC20Upgradeable, OwnableUpgradeable

// Security patterns
modifier onlyAuthorized() {
    require(authorizedMinters[msg.sender], "Not authorized");
    _;
}

// Gas optimization
function batchTransfer(address[] calldata recipients, uint256[] calldata amounts)
```

### **React Patterns**
```typescript
// Custom hooks for Web3
const { account, balance, connect } = useWeb3();

// Context for state management
const Web3Provider: React.FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
    // Web3 state management
};

// Component patterns with TypeScript
interface ComponentProps {
    onSuccess: (result: TransactionResult) => void;
}
```

### **Backend Patterns**
```javascript
// Service layer architecture
class BlockchainService {
    async monitorEvents() {
        // Event monitoring implementation
    }
}

// Middleware patterns
const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
    // JWT validation
};
```

## üß™ Testing Methodologies

### **Smart Contract Testing**
- **Unit tests** for individual contract functions
- **Integration tests** for cross-contract interactions
- **Security testing** for common vulnerabilities
- **Gas optimization** testing and benchmarking

### **Frontend Testing**
- **Component testing** with React Testing Library
- **Hook testing** for custom React hooks
- **Integration testing** for Web3 flows
- **E2E testing** scenarios

### **Backend Testing**
- **API endpoint** testing with comprehensive coverage
- **Database integration** testing
- **Authentication flow** testing
- **Service layer** unit testing

## üîß Development Workflow

### **Code Quality Standards**
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety
- **ESLint & Prettier** for consistent formatting
- **Husky hooks** for pre-commit validation
- **Conventional commits** for clear git history

### **Architecture Decisions**

#### **Why UUPS Proxy Pattern?**
Demonstrates advanced smart contract upgradeability while maintaining security and minimizing gas costs.

#### **Why GSAP for Animations?**
Shows premium UI development capabilities beyond basic CSS animations.

#### **Why PostgreSQL + Redis?**
Illustrates proper data architecture for blockchain applications with both persistent storage and caching.
